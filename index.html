# Paradise in Progress studio deploys radical research agenda to unlearn/rethink colonial>contemporary structures of tourism in context of Thailand and propose to use cinema/game engines as simulation techniques for alternative spatial scenarios and discuss potential relationships between travel, real estate and climate change, focusing on updated governing models that recognizes interdependency of human and non-human agents and importance of care. The idea of progress has long associations with the image of travel. Movement in space, arrival to the “destination” carries the promise of the “rite the passage” - “experience” of the “new” - an exposure to the “other” which has the ability to transform, restore or reboot the “self” - the body and mind of the visitor. Paradoxically, this hyper preservation of media-constructed image of the place, goes hand in hand with rapid development and transformation to sustain the growth of the industry, flattening geological, cultural, social and ecosystems into “experience” “attention” quantification.

While 2019 recorded the highest number of global tourists (1,500,000,000,000 / 1.5 billion) alongside with overwhelming number of those in motion, yet outside official rankings (6,500,000,000,000) - year 2020 brought global mobility to halt - affecting lives of many and deepening social inequalities. More than ever before, fueled by abuse of power, systemic violence and political incompetency, social unrest was live-streamed across the globe rendering incapacity of economical models we depend too much on in face of global disaster. Yet, with the pressuring attempt to restore economies to status quo, the very same failed models are now being reinforced, leaving too many voiceless, vulnerable and again, without choice. Worldwide, re-branded as “new” tourist/travel models are being tested - from only 5-star luxurious resorts open to Travel Bubbles/Special Touristic Zones to reboot the economy attracting both international and regional visitors while responding to strict quarantine policies. Here, the imperial/colonial focus on the “tourist/visitor” continues to be a driving factor of deployed strategies and the only way their success is being measured or checked, at the same time flattening ecosystems into pool-side/lawn infrastructures, local people into hosts and privatizing beaches into instagram backdrops unaccessible to residents. With so many human and non-human lives depending on those policies and regulations, lack of exposure disables the real potential for inclusive change, only to reinforce old and abusive foundations of contemporary tourism. Yet, seeing now many radical laws and immediate territorial, socio-geological solutions being implemented on national/global scales, this studio would take it as opportunity and look into alternative models in design and planning for tourism in Thailand, anticipating rapidly changing climate and environmental conditions, human and non-human, biological, cultural, geographical, chemical interdependency to discuss “radical” ecologies in place of obsolete economies.

In this studio you will develop your understanding about formal and informal contextual correlations established by tourism industry, looking into real estate in Bangkok as your main point of departure. Hotels, spas, massage parlors, restaurants, airports, quarantine infrastructure, tourist attractions, national parks, heritage places, museums, markets and more - all of those are settings where lives of human and non-human intersect dependent on the growth of tourism industry and flow of visitors - shaped by laws and regulations, global markets, corporations, infrastructures, mass media and marketing algorithms, dreams and desires. Thailand, one of the most popular travel destinations has been isolated from foreign visitors since March 2020. Cities, islands, towns, districts, streets, hotels has been deserted ever since, leaving many with uncertain future shaped by questionable economical and political strategies. To better understand current context you will deploy forensic tools to interview, photograph, model, reconstruct, trace histories to uncover interdependencies behind topic of tourism and develop framework for your following studies by outlining key concepts. Developed protocols/strategies/concepts will be used as your research toolkit/compass during the field trip to further document and analyze selected topics in Bangkok, Pattaya and Koh Samui. During the next part of the semester you will develop fictional spatial scenario on individually selected scale to research through design alternative models of tourism as potential/preferable future. Cinema and game engines will be used as medium to rethink, develop, narrate and present strategies towards more inclusive design/planning.

Semester Structure

> Studio prioritize discussion and collective knowledge exchange where individual actively participate in tutorials
> Studio is divided into 3 phases: (i) building knowledge and tools, (ii) field trip and (iii) worlding/building narratives.
> During the course of the semester you will be asked to read 2 books that are supplementary to developing your broader understanding about the topic of the studio. You will be divided into 2 groups reading one book at the time. Every few tutorials we will have collective session about the topics that are discussed in the books.
> Every tutorial you will bring one document (1-2 spreads) with individually graphically evaluated and developed progress
> 


Phase 1 (Building knowledge/forensic toolkit/focal points)

Semester will start with 3 week exploration of tourism history, contemporary and related real estate while building your understanding about the topic. You will develop maps, concepts, strategies, protocols from uncovered infrastructures, transformed ecosystems, correlations, local stories, policies and more. Micro-holidays, staycations, weekend trips, annual leaves, netflix binge watching, instagram travel accounts, bbc planet earth, stories from adventures of the life time - in all of those little moments the immense infrastructure, landscape, workforce, energy and planetary resources are being involved in need to sustain the free time. Departing from real estate, you will trace, collect, organize and map context behind tourism and build the knowledge/perception framework that you will use later in your studies, investigations and field trip as focal points.

Phase 2 (field trip)

From the study social, climate, cultural, urban and economical aspects of free time/tourism/tourist industry/real estate students will develop the research toolkit of defined topics/patterns and categories and deploy their forensic methods during the field trip. Looking into various contexts of Thai landscape  - from the urban context of 1. Bangkok, most visited city in the world, 2. Pattaya City - developed around, from and for tourism to 3. Koh Samui - potentially touristic landscapes, students will investigate current and historical contexts to uncover the relationships and forces that took/are taking part in shaping contemporary landscapes.

Phase 3 (building scenario, research through design)

In this phase student will develop cinematic scenario.


Studio Structure/Methodology

Studio will experiment with format of tutorials, reviews and evaluation.

Tutorials

Working with research through design as the studio method, tutorials will be divided into 2 categories where alternate discussion about development/production of the project and research/concept/world building will happen weekly. Having one week to organize material for the tutorial aim to enable more comprehensive exploration of the topic, yet requires from the student consistency and independence.

Reviews

Studio is focused on discussion and exchange of the knowledge. Instead of presentation-answer based review format it will introduce conference/talk format to focus more on collaborative methods of building knowledge, hence students will be asked:

One week before the review:

- (preliminary) bring individual and group list of selected topics and concepts towards the main brief of the studio, displaying overlaps, correlations between studies, common interests etc
- (preliminary) based on the topics, overlaps, correlations to have multiple questions/ideas/concepts outlined that will serve as structure for debate moderation

One tutorial before the review:

- finalized list of individual and group topics
- complete list of questions/ideas for moderation

Review: (50% of the grade) 

- review will be moderated based on the list of predefined topics and questions
- each student will have to fully participate in the whole review conference presenting their individual studies as the answers the questions, explorations of the topics, aspects of the brief
- instructor and guest will ask supportive questions towards general brief and individual topics

One week after review (50% of the grade)

- students will submit the paper/essay/critique commenting the overall conference, outlining important aspects of the topic, reviewing other students works, suggesting improvements, noticing important parts
